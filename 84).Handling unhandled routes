what if we have unhandled routes
how can we manage them
we will use 
app.all 
this is for all the methods get,post,patch,and delete
the order of the middleware matters a lot in middleware
app.all('*',(req,res,next)=>
{
    res.status(400).json(
        {
            status:'fail',
            message: `can't find requested ${req.originalUrl}`

        })

})
