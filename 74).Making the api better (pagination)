it allows the users to select aparticular fields in case we have a lots of page
suppose we have 1000 documents in a certain collection and lets assume we have 100 documents on a single page
so it means it have 10 pages
so how are we going to include our pagination using our query string so we will use the limit and the page fields
?page=5&limit=10(so it simply mens page no 2 of limit 10)
here is the limit of the document we want per page
The method to do pagination is the skip method
skip(2)skip contains a random number
skip(2).limit(10)
skip generallly means the amount of result that we want to skip before actually quering data
?page=2&limit=10
that means 1 to 10 are on the page 1 and 11 to 20 are on the page 2
so this means that we want to skip 10results before we starts querying
tours1=tour1.skip(10).limit(10);
 const page=req.query.page * 1 || 1;//converting the string to the number
  const limit=req.query.limit * 1  || 100;//converting the string to the number
  //
  //
  //
  //
  code for pagination
  const page=req.query.page * 1 || 1;//converting the string to the number
  const limit=req.query.limit * 1  || 100;
                                  //converting the string to the number
  const skip=(page-1) * limit;
 tours1=tours1.skip(skip).limit(limit);//for page 2
const tour5=await tours1;
