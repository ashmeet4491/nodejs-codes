There is a error handling middleware through which we can easily handle an error o this kind 
like a user requested a URL which is not available so this kind of middleware do work
We have to give a middleware a four  arguments so that the express automaticaly recognizes it 
we will provide it with four arguments named as (err,req,res,next)
then we will have to create an error by using  an Error constructor(buildin)
