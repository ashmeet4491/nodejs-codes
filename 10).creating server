const fs=require('fs');
const http=require('http');

http.createServer((req,res)=>
{
res.end("hey from the server");
});
//whernever a request is sent to the server the server response back with
response function 
"hey from the server"
now the second step include the request coming from the client
so so here we are making an object name as server
const server=http.createServer((req,res)=>
{
res.end("hey from the server");
});
server.listen(8000,'127.0.0.1',()=>         //here the server started listening to the requests and 
                                              responses with 'listening to the server'
{
    console.log('listening to request on port 8000');
})
