A client makes the request and the server responses to that request.
for example-http://www.google.com/Api
http is a protocol
www.google.com is a domain name 
and Api is a resource
www.google.com is not the name of the server.
instead it is the name which is easy to remember.
DNS(DOMAIN NAME SERVER)-when browser makes request to the server.the DNS maps the web address to the servers ip address.
port no is to specify a specific service running on a server.
The real address looks somewhat like this
http://120.8.0.1:443
here 120.8.0.1 is the ip address 
and the 443 is the port no
Once we have the real ip address the socket connection is established between the Client and the server.
TCP- transmission control protocol
and IP is the Internet protocol tha defines how data travels across the whole system.
after this we  make a http request.which contain http methods headers and body(if we are sending te data).


methods-
GET- for requesting data
post-for sending data
HTTPS IS ENCRYPTED
