a queary middlewre is that middleware which is going to execute after the find statement
in find we are not going to process any documents .instead we are going to process the query
Suppose we have some secret tours so we want a particular Vip group of people to have access to that tours
tour_schema.pre('find',function(next) {
          this.find({secret_tour:{$ne;true}});
          next();
        })
        and this here points to query not to the documents
          tour_schema.pre(/^find/,function(next) {
          this.find({secret_tour:{$ne:true}});
          next();
        })
         tour_schema.pre(/^find/,function(next) {
          this.find({secret_tour:{$ne:true}});
          this.start=Date.now();
          next();
        })
        here above we are using regular expressions so it will be triggered for all the statements starting with find
the post method have access to all the documents that we are going to use
tour_schema.post(/^find/,function(docs,next) {
          console.log(`${Date.now()-this.start}`);
          console.log(docs);
          next();
        })
