we can also built our custom validators
a VALIDATOR is a function
for validation we use the validate form 
validate uses the callback function
 validate:function (val) 
 {
 return val<this.price;
 }
 this function will return either true or false 
 the 'this' keyword is going to point to the current document
 go t0 validators github open the first link where all the custom validorts are used
 u can grab these libraries and plug them into validators
 so before using validators 
just do
install npm validator -g(include -g for global)
if this is not working then u can install python in extension

we will define breakpoints in the code such that our codes stops running
it will freeze so we can
