for choosing which field they want to get back in the response is called the limiting field
The process of selecting a particular field name is called selecting
if(req.query.fields)
  {
    const field=req.query.fields.split(`,`).join(` `);
    console.log(field);
    tours1=tours1.select(field);
  }
  else
  {
    tours1=tours1.select(`-__v`);
  }
  so we donot want to expose everything to the user so do the tourmodel1 and set the property of the select:false 
  
   createdate:
                {
                    type:Date  ,
                    default:Date.now(),
                    select:false  //this will give us the time in ms //it is a javascript function
                },
                so we can permanently hide this info from the user
