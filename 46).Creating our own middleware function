Middleware is used to manipulate the the request or the response objects
we used express.json for the request
the order of the middleware is the order in which they are executed
in order to use middleware we generally use app.use(expess.json())
express.json() is a function that returns the method we add to the middleware stack
for a middleware we have the a req and a response
but for making our own middleware we have a third argument also which is called 
next is very important because without next argument we wont be able to send the 
request to the client side
the middleware should always be there before the route function
the order matters alot in express
We can also manupulate req object ussing miiddleware
Making of the own middleware
const express=require('express');
const app=express();
const fs=require('fs');
const file=fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/tour-simple.json`);
const file_read=JSON.parse(file);
app.use(express.json());
app.use((req,res,next)=>
{
console.log('hello from the middleware');
next();
})
app.use((req,res,next)=>
{
    req.requestTime=new Date().toISOString();
    
    next();


})
app.get('/app',(req,res)=>
{
    console.log(req.requestTime);
        res.status(400).json({
            status:"error",
            requestedat:req.requestTime,
            message:"file could not be sent"
        })

})
app.listen(3000,()=>
{
    console.log('listening');
})
