we are going to use a which e hosted remote service hosted on a service which is called ATLAS
which is owned by the same company which owns mongodb
we will basically use a cloud service which is called Atlas
it will manage and scale the databses now its not our reponsibility
it is always advisable to have the data on the cloud 
so that we can access it from anywhere
so here we going to use remote databases instead of messing it with local databases
so  the internet is nessary for a hosted applicationne
create a new project in Atlas 
and then creating a cluster for the new project
connecting that to our mongodb campas
so that if we are adding something to our mongodb campus 
it will be automatically added to our cloud Atlas
now we have to allow access to this cluster to everywhere
and connect to the mongo shell as well
and next is to coonect our shell to the database application and now this way  
can access our cloud  databses
