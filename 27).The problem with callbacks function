we will make a file of name known as dog.txt
where we are supposed to retrieve the name of the dog and acoording to the dog breed assign the image
and save that random image in a text file
so here we are using the API known as the dog.ceo
here we are going to use superagent 
so to install superagent we will use 
npm install superagent
const fs=require('fs');
const superagent=require('superagent'); 
const read=fs.readFile(`${__dirname}/dog.txt`,(err,data1)=>
{
if(err)
{
    console.log(`${err}`);
}
else{
        console.log(`Breed:${data1}`);
}
superagent.get(`https://dog.ceo/api/breed/${data1}/images/random
`).end((err,res)=>
{
    if(err)
    {
        console.log(err.message);

    }
    console.log(res.body.message);
    fs.writeFile('dog-image2.txt',res.body.message,err=>
{
    console.log("Random dog image saves to file");
})
});

    
})
//calbacks are difficult to understand so thats why we use here is a promises.which i will write in next code.

//here we are having a callback function inside other callback function
//superagent is algo used for sending and recieving requests.
