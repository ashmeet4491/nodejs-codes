Application programming interface is a piece of software that is used by another piece of software in order to allow the application to
interact with each other.
it is not dnly use for sending and recieving data from the server to the client.
like for example we have a Api KNOWN AS 'fs' in nodesjs it is also used to read the file
REST is representational state transfer
We will bulid the Api following the rest architecture
for building the restful API we just need to follow the following principals
1).Seperate API into logical resources
2).Expose structured based URL
3).it shouls use the 'http method ' and not the URL
4).data dend from the client to serverand data send from the server to the client must be in JSON format
5).they must be stateless
A post request is used to send t e data from the client
Important
if a /tour is accessed using get method we send data to the  client
but if same /tour is accressed with post data to come in from the client
there are another method such as put and patch
the major difference between put and patch is 
In put the client is supposed to send entire updated object
while in patch we send only that data that has been updated
Delete is also a request and the client should be authenticated  
so that the client can perform CRUD operations
Create,read,Update and delete operation
create is performed by GET
read is performed by POST 
Update is performed by put and patch
Delete is performed by delete
JSON IS A LIGHT WEIGHT DATA INTERCHANGE FORMAT which is heavily used by web API coded in any language
when we ar sending the response to the client we are  we ahve to format the json using jsend
it should be stateless means that all states are handled on the client side and not on the server
and the state refers to data that might change over time
example of state like the user is logged in
