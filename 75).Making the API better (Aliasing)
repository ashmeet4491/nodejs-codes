this feature provides a aliase to the route
so here we are going to provide a route that is simple and easy to implement
we want to call this get_all_tours method

router.route('/top-5-cheap').get(tour_controller2.get_all_tours);
but before calling this method we have to specify the query string
so we will use a middleware before it
so the middleware is going to manipulate the query object
exports.alias_top_tours=(req,res,next)=>
{
req.query.limit=5;
req.query.sort='price,ratingsAverage';
req.query.fields='name,price,ratinsAverage';
next();
}
