there is no use of using a id known as a middleware known as check id because mongodb will itself give the error if are fetching wrong id
ANOTHER way of creating document  that is a way easier than we didi before
so here we will use the method create for 
we will use here 
Tour.create(
{
})
and this will return a promise as well

exports.post_tours= async (req,res)=>
{
    try{
    const new_tour= await Tour.create(req.body);
    res.status(200).json(
        {
            status:"success",
            data:
            {
              new_tour
            }
        })
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        res.status(400).json(
            {
                status:"fail",
                message:
                {
                    err
                }
            })
    }
}
if we have not defined something in the schema and we are putting it on the body in the sending th post request then 
there will be a not be  a problem but that will not be saved in a cloud database
