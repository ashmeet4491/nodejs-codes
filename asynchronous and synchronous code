synchronous code is basically a blocking code.
Asynchronous code is basically a non blocking code.
Nodejs is basically a Single thread
the code get executed in a single thread.
so if one user is blocks  a code
no other user will can access  a code.
we use a Asynchronous code
where the read file function get executed in the background
and the other task gets executed simultaneously.
