we never ever accept input data comimg from the user itself
maxlength:[40,'a string must have 40 characters'],
minlength:[10,'a string must have at least 10 character']
this min length and max length is only for the length and not the number
 enum:{
 values:['easy','medium','difficult'],
 message:'a difficulty can only be easy,medium or difficult'
 }
 it can also be written as 
 enum:['easy','medium','difficult']
 enum is just used for the string
 but for showing the error message we will use the above conditions
  min:[1,'rating must be atleast 1'],
  max:[5,'ratinstring must be atmax 5']
  this min and max is for the number for can also be used for the string.
  these above are data validators
