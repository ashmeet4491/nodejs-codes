Make the file named as test-module3.js and write the code
console.log("Hello from the function");
module.exports=()=>
{
    console.log("Lock  this beautifule object");
}
make another  file named as modules.js
require("./test-module3")();
require("./test-module3")();
require("./test-module3")();
here the output it gives is 
Hello from the function
Lock  this beautifule object
Lock  this beautifule object
Lock  this beautifule object
because the file is loaded only once and the caching is going on in this module
so the value is saved somewhere and called everytime when a function is called
