Node js has several dependencies.
Nodejs consist of libuv and V8
V8 is an engine that converts the javascript code to machine code that the computer can understand.
LIBUV is an open source library having an strong focus on Asynchronous library.
this layer gives the persmission to operate the Asynchronous io
The two important features of node js is the event loop and the thread loop
the event loop is for the light work
whereas the thread loop is for the heavy work.
libv is completely written in c++
wheras the V8 is written in javascript and nodejs.
so Nodejs is both written in javascript as well as a nodejs
A thread is a sequence of instruction
Node runs in a single thread so its easy to block the application.
