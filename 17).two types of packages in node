Simple Dependencies and development dependies
Simple dependiences contains codes that is used to built application
for example-express.
install slugify using npm install slugify.
slugify -for more readable url.
for installing slugify just write down 
npm install slugify.
when we create this.it makes a new dependencies and and add the dependency to
the pakage.json file
development dependency is for the development of the application
for example-the nodemon
for installing the nodemon dependency we use 
npm install nodemon --save-dev(dev is a short form for development)
so basically what it does it adds this dependency and add the dependency in the devdepency in the package.json file.
nodemon is a tool that helps us develop the node application.
with this ,automatically it will restart the server everytime we make a change.
for not installing the nodemon again
we simply make it globally
npm install nodemon --global
so for running the file we will write nodemon "filename"
we cannot use locally installed nodemon in a command line
for locally we will write the code in script instead of writing it down on a command line.
the script  contains start where we will write that.
then write npm rum start
but a simple method to use nodemon is write the nodemon createserver.js in command line.
