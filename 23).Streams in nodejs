Streams-used to read the data chunks by chunks without completing the whole read and write operation fully so without
keeping all the data in memory
like for example in netflix and youtube 
without waiting for the whole file to read the processing is done piece by piece
so you start watching even before the entire file is downloaded
so streamhandling large amounts are of data.

streaming makes the data processing more efficient in terms of memory
There are four types of streams in nodejs
1).Readble streams 
2).Writable streams
3).Duplex streams
4).Transform streams
Readable streams are the streams to which we consume data
Writable streams are the ones to which we write data
Streams are the instances of the Eventemitter  class.
Important event of  readable stream are data and end
Important function of Readable streams are pipe and read event
Important events are drain and finish
Important functions are write and end
Duplex streams are those streams which are both writable as well as readable at the same time
Transform steam are those stream which are used to modify the data.
